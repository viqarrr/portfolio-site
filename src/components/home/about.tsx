          I’m a student at SMK Negeri 12 Surabaya, specializing in Front-End Web Development and Game Programming.
Since 2023, I’ve worked on web and game projects using technologies like Tailwind CSS, PHP, React.js, Unity, and C#.
I enjoy solving problems, collaborating in teams, and turning ideas into real, functional products.
